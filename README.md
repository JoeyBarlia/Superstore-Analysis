### Fix discount system so that best-selling products (binders, art, storage, paper) are sold with little to no discount.

### Products with limited sales and higher profitability (copiers, accessories, phones) should be sold at a higher discount to attract customers.

### An investigation and/or audit of the Africa and EMEA markets is highly recommended to get an in-depth understanding of their financial situations

### The company should renegotiate rates with its shipping partners.

### Investigate what factors besides low cost contributed to record profit in November 2013

### Employ retention, development, recapture measures to customers according to their classification.
